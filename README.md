> ðŸš§ This was made for my own pressing need as a JetBrains user and budding Cairo programmer. I'm not an expert JetBrains plugin developer nor Kotlin programmer. That was a lot of words to say "this plugin kinda sorta works".

The Cairo language plugin for JetBrains products. This uses the [Cairo Language Server](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/main/vscode-cairo/README.md#install-the-cairo-language-server).
